# 3D object distance estimation from the BEV representations
This project shows the LiDAR-to-image-based method for metric distance estimation with 3D bounding box projections onto the image. We demonstrate that despite the general difficulty of the BEV representation in understanding features related to the height coordinate, it is possible to extract all parameters characterizing the bounding boxes of the objects, including their height and elevation. Finally, we applied the triangulation method to calculate the accurate distance to the objects and statistically proved that our methodology is one of the best in terms of accuracy and robustness.

This is the extension code for the [Super Fast and Accurate 3D Object Detection based on 3D LiDAR Point Clouds](https://github.com/maudzung/SFA3D)

## Highlights
1. Fast training, fast inference
2. Ancho-free approach
3. Support distributed parallel training
